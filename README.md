# Merge Sort Project

This C++ program generates a list of random integers and sorts them using merge sort. Additionally, it measures execution time and peak memory usage.

# How to run
1. Compile with g++
    Example: g++ dandp.cpp -o yourprogram -lpsapi
2. Run it by: ./yourprogram

You will be asked for three inputs these are Size of list, smallest element in list, and largest element in list

This means that if u want a list that has 5 elements then u will enter the digit 5
If you want your list to be from a range of 0-10 then..
for smallest element input 0
for largest element input 10
